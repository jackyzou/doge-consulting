    cat1Title: "Shipping & Logistics",
    cat1Q1: "How long does shipping take from China to Seattle?",
    cat1A1: "Sea freight typically takes 20-35 days depending on the shipping method (LCL vs FCL). With sourcing, inspection, packing, and last-mile delivery, the total door-to-door timeline is approximately 5-8 weeks.",
    cat1Q2: "What is the difference between LCL and FCL?",
    cat1A2: "LCL (Less than Container Load) means your cargo shares a container with other shipments — you pay per cubic meter. FCL (Full Container Load) means you get a dedicated container. FCL is more cost-effective for larger shipments (generally above 15 CBM).",
    cat1Q3: "What container sizes are available?",
    cat1A3: "We offer 20ft containers (~28 CBM), 40ft containers (~58 CBM), and 40ft High Cube containers (~68 CBM). Our team will recommend the best option based on your product list.",
    cat1Q4: "Can you ship to cities other than Seattle?",
    cat1A4: "Currently, our primary service area is the Greater Seattle/Puget Sound region (Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Tacoma, Kirkland, etc.). We're expanding to Vancouver, BC and Portland, OR in 2026.",
    cat1Q5: "Do you provide tracking?",
    cat1A5: "Yes! Every shipment receives a unique tracking ID. You can track your shipment's progress through our website, from factory to your front door, with milestone updates at every stage.",
    cat2Title: "Products & Sourcing",
    cat2Q1: "What products can you source from China?",
    cat2A1: "China is the world's manufacturing powerhouse. We can source furniture (from Foshan), electronics (from Shenzhen), home goods, textiles, industrial equipment, small commodities (from Yiwu), and custom products.",
    cat2Q2: "How much can I save compared to buying locally?",
    cat2A2: "Most customers save 40-60% compared to US retail prices, even after shipping costs. For example, a marble dining table set that costs $5,000+ in the US can be sourced and shipped for around $2,000-$2,500 total.",
    cat2Q3: "Can I see the products before they ship?",
    cat2A3: "Yes! Our China team provides detailed photos and videos of your products during quality inspection, before they're packed. We'll send these to you for approval before shipping.",
    cat2Q4: "What if I receive damaged products?",
    cat2A4: "All shipments are professionally packed for ocean transport. If damage occurs, our cargo insurance (optional but recommended) covers full replacement value. We also work with manufacturers on warranty claims.",
    cat3Title: "Payment & Pricing",
    cat3Q1: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    cat3A1: "We accept major credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) and bank transfers through our secure Airwallex payment system. For large orders (>$5,000), we also accept wire transfers with lower processing fees.",
    cat3Q2: "Do I need to pay everything upfront?",
    cat3A2: "For first-time customers, we typically require 70% deposit when placing the order, with the remaining 30% due before delivery. For returning customers, we offer more flexible terms.",
    cat3Q3: "Are there any hidden fees?",
    cat3A3: "No. Our quotes are all-inclusive, covering product cost, packing, freight, customs clearance, and delivery. The only potential additions are cargo insurance (optional) and any unusual customs duties.",
    cat3Q4: "What currency do you charge in?",
    cat3A4: "All prices are quoted and charged in US Dollars (USD). Our Hong Kong-based payment system handles currency conversion seamlessly.",
    cat4Title: "Customs & Regulations",
    cat4Q1: "Do I need to handle customs myself?",
    cat4A1: "No! We handle all customs clearance on both the China export and US import side. Our experienced customs brokers ensure smooth clearance at both ports.",
    cat4Q2: "Are there import duties on products from China?",
    cat4A2: "Import duties to the US vary by product category, typically ranging from 0-25% depending on the type and material. Our team will provide a duty estimate as part of your quote.",
    cat4Q3: "Is there anything that can't be shipped?",
    cat4A3: "Most products ship without issue. Some restricted items include hazardous materials, certain chemicals, and products with protected woods (requiring CITES permits). We'll advise you during the quoting process.",
